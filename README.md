# Smart Dustbin: IoT-Enabled Waste Management System

## Objective
We’re building a smart dustbin that can classify and sort waste automatically into three categories: **biodegradable, recyclable, and non-recyclable**. The goal is to make waste management more efficient, convenient, and eco-friendly, reducing the burden on users and encouraging better waste segregation habits. Additionally, we aim to provide useful tools for both residents and municipal authorities, which will help to promote cleaner environments, reduce waste mismanagement, and improve recycling efforts.

## Implementation
### IoT-Enabled Smart Bins
#### Hardware:
- IoT-enabled waste bins equipped with:
  - **ESP32-CAM** for waste classification
  - **Ultrasonic sensors** for fill-level monitoring
  - **Servo motors** for segregation

#### Functionality:
- The bins automatically sort waste into **biodegradable, recyclable, or non-recyclable** categories.
- Fill-level data is transmitted in real-time to the cloud.

### Web App for Residents
#### Purpose:
- Residents use the app to:
  - Check **waste collection schedules**
  - Locate nearby **recycling centers**
  - Get updates on **environmental initiatives**

#### Tech Stack:
- **React** for web
- **Node.js and Express** for backend APIs
- **TypeScript** for consistency and scalability

### Data Analytics for Optimization
#### Objective:
- Analyze **fill-level data** from bins
- Optimize **waste collection routes and schedules** for efficiency

#### Tools:
- **Python ** for data analysis


### Municipal Dashboard
#### Features:
- A centralized dashboard for municipal authorities to:
  - **Monitor fill levels**
  - **View optimized routes**
  - **Schedule collections**
  - **Track system performance**

#### Tech Stack:
- **React** for frontend
- **Express and Node.js** for backend
- Integration with **cloud platforms** for real-time data

## Software Applications
- **For Residents:** Convenient tracking of waste schedules and recycling centers to encourage participation in waste management.
- **For Municipalities:** Improved visibility into waste collection, reduced operational costs, and better service delivery.

## Route Optimization with Mapbox/Google Maps API
To make waste collection as efficient as possible, we’ll be using **Mapbox API or Google Maps API** for route optimization:

1. The system will analyze **sensor fill-level data** from all bins in real-time.
2. Bins that are **full or more than 50% full** for a particular day will be flagged.
3. Using the APIs, **optimized routes** will be generated for collection vehicles to **minimize travel time and fuel usage** (**A* algorithm**).
4. **Traffic and location** are also considered while deciding the best possible routes for garbage collection vehicles.

## Final Result
The smart waste management system will be a cohesive platform where:

- **Residents** can participate actively in waste segregation and recycling.
- **Municipal authorities** can efficiently manage collection schedules, reducing costs and environmental impact.
- **Data analytics** ensures continuous improvement in logistics and resource allocation.
